## Zomato Analytics Dashboard: Global Restaurant & Cuisine Insights
An interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze Zomato restaurant data across multiple countries—focusing on restaurant distribution,
customer ratings, cuisines, pricing, online services, and growth trends.

The Zomato Analytics Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of restaurant performance and customer preferences across cities and countries. 
It helps stakeholders understand dining trends, popular cuisines, pricing patterns, and service availability such as online delivery and table booking.

## The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
 Power BI Desktop – Primary tool for data visualization and dashboard development
 Power Query – Used for data cleaning, transformation, and shaping
 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Created calculated measures and KPIs such as total restaurants, average ratings, votes, and sales
 Data Modeling – Structured relationships between restaurant, city, country, cuisine, and date attributes for accurate cross-filtering
 File Format – .pbit / .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews

## Source: Zomato restaurant dataset
  The dataset contains information about restaurants across 15 countries and 140+ cities, including:
   Restaurant names and locations
   Cuisine types
   Customer ratings and votes
   Price range and average cost for two
   Online delivery and table booking availability
   Year of restaurant opening
   The data was structured and transformed to support multi-dimensional analysis by city, country, cuisine, cost, and time.

  ## Business Problem

With thousands of restaurants listed on food delivery platforms like Zomato, it becomes difficult for businesses and analysts to quickly answer questions such as:
Which cities and countries have the highest restaurant concentration?
What cuisines are most popular based on customer votes?
How do ratings vary by city and price range?
How many restaurants offer online delivery or table booking?
What pricing segments dominate different regions?
Raw datasets make this analysis time-consuming and non-intuitive.

## Goal of the Dashboard

To build an interactive and visually intuitive analytics dashboard that:
Enables city-wise and country-wise restaurant analysis
Helps identify popular cuisines and pricing segments
Analyzes customer behavior through ratings and votes
Supports data-driven decisions for food-tech companies, restaurant owners, and market analysts
